# XAF - How to implement dependent views in a DashboardView (filter based on selection)

This example illustrates how to filter a ListView displayed in a DashboardView based on another ListView's selection.

## Scenario

When a [DashboardView](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.DashboardView) contains several list views, it is often required to make them dependent, e.g. display items of one ListView based on items or selection of another ListView.

## Implementation Details
1. Add a new [ViewController](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.ViewController) to the **YourSolutionName.Module** project. For more information, refer to the following file: [DashboardFilterController.cs](./CS/EFCore/DependentDashboardEF/DependentDashboardEF.Module/Controllers/DashboardFilterController.cs).
2. Access the target and source views.
3. Handle the source view's list view selection changed event.
4. Filter the target view in the event handler.
